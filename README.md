# BUDDYWORKS Toolbox
Little toolbox with various features.
VRCFury prefab for easy installation. (I hope)

**WORK IN PROGRESS ASSET**

Features:
**Torch:** A simple flashlight, it is attached to your view and looks a bit like old unity horror game flashlights. (Just a simple light, no 3D model)
**Nameplate Viewer:** Allows you to see nametags from virtually any distance to find friends easily.
**GreenScreen:** A simple GreenScreen to be used for specific Chroma-Keyed MR applications.
**Polygon overlay:** A simple in-game overlay showing polygons.

More soon, whenever I come up with something.

Dependencies:
