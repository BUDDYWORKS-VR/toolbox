VRCFury prefabs for easy installation. (I hope)

**Nameplate Viewer**  
When enabled, allows you to see nametags (and possibly other UI) through walls.  
This component is designed to help you find your friends in bigger worlds.  

**Lights**  
Assortment of features to brighten up your view, or the whole scene.  
Uses 2 lights.  

**Wireframe**  
Viewpoint overlay which allows you to see an estimated wireframe layout of meshes in the world. Might not always be too accurate.  
Uses 1 light.  

**Greenscreen**  
Made to be used with Virtual Desktop’s Pasthrough Chroma-Cutout feature.  
Spawns a sphere around you, use the dials to adjust radius and color.  
Might not work well when the world uses Post Processing, try to turn Post Processing off if it misbehaves.  

**PlayerMover**  
Radial-controlled station that can move players to otherwise unreachable places.
